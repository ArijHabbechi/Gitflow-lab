    <h1>GitFlow Workflow Practice</h1>
    
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>This repository has been created to serve as a practical exercise for mastering the <strong>GitFlow Workflow</strong>, 
    a branching model for Git developed by Vincent Driessen. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how GitFlow can 
    be used effectively in real-world software development environments, especially for managing multiple parallel feature 
    developments, bug fixes, and releases.</p>
    <h2>Contributors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arij Habbechi</strong> - Lead Developer</li>
        <li><strong>Chaima Raach</strong> - UI/UX Designer</li>
  
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <p>The GitFlow model is ideal for projects with a continuous development cycle and emphasizes the clear separation of 
    various branches used for different tasks. Through this exercise, we aim to explore the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Branching strategies:</strong> How to organize and manage multiple branches for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.</li>
        <li><strong>Merge techniques:</strong> Best practices for merging branches and resolving conflicts between feature and development branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Version tagging:</strong> Tagging and maintaining stable releases, preparing for deployments.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Using GitFlow to streamline collaboration between team members by clearly defining the purpose of each branch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the GitFlow Workflow and how it organizes the development process with distinct branches for feature, release, hotfix, and develop.</li>
        <li>Practice creating and switching between branches for different development purposes.</li>
        <li>Perform commits on individual branches and practice merging them back into <code>develop</code> and <code>main</code>.</li>
        <li>Learn how to tag releases for deployment and simulate versioning.</li>
        <li>Experience collaborative work in a simulated environment using pull requests and merging branches with conflict resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Repository Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>main</code> branch: Represents the stable production-ready code.</li>
        <li><code>develop</code> branch: The integration branch where features and fixes are merged before release.</li>
        <li><code>feature/</code> branches: Created for the development of individual features.</li>
        <li><code>release/</code> branches: Used for preparing the next release, allowing final adjustments before merging into <code>main</code>.</li>
        <li><code>hotfix/</code> branches: Created from <code>main</code> to apply urgent fixes directly in production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>To learn more about GitFlow and its advantages, refer to this detailed tutorial:

    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By practicing the GitFlow workflow with this repository, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to manage complex 
    development tasks in a collaborative and structured environment, while maintaining code stability and ensuring smooth 
    deployments.</p>
