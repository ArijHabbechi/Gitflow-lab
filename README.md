# GitFlow Workflow Practice

## Objective

This repository has been created to serve as a practical exercise for mastering the **GitFlow Workflow**, a branching model for Git developed by Vincent Driessen. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how GitFlow can be used effectively in real-world software development environments, especially for managing multiple parallel feature developments, bug fixes, and releases.

The GitFlow model is ideal for projects with a continuous development cycle and emphasizes the clear separation of various branches used for different tasks. Through this exercise, we aim to explore the following key principles:

- **Branching strategies**: How to organize and manage multiple branches for feature development, bug fixes, and releases.
- **Merge techniques**: Best practices for merging branches and resolving conflicts between feature and development branches.
- **Version tagging**: Tagging and maintaining stable releases, preparing for deployments.
- **Collaboration**: Using GitFlow to streamline collaboration between team members by clearly defining the purpose of each branch.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understand the GitFlow Workflow**: Learn how GitFlow can help in organizing the development process with distinct branches for `feature`, `release`, `hotfix`, and `develop`.
2. **Branch Creation and Management**: Practice creating and switching between branches for different development purposes (features, fixes, releases).
3. **Commit and Merge Operations**: Perform commits on individual branches and practice merging them back into `develop` and `main` (or `master`), following GitFlow conventions.
4. **Version Tagging and Releases**: Learn how to tag releases for deployment and simulate versioning.
5. **Collaboration Simulation**: Experience collaborative work in a simulated environment by using pull requests and merging branches with conflict resolution.

## Repository Structure

- `main` branch: Represents the stable production-ready code.
- `develop` branch: The integration branch where features and fixes are merged before release.
- `feature/` branches: Created for the development of individual features.
- `release/` branches: Used for preparing the next release, allowing final adjustments before merging into `main`.
- `hotfix/` branches: Created from `main` to apply urgent fixes directly in production.

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Follow the steps defined in the tutorial:
   - Create feature branches for individual tasks.
   - Merge them into `develop`.
   - Create release and hotfix branches as needed.
   - Tag the versioned releases.
3. Push your changes to the remote repository and verify using GitHub or other Git hosting platforms.
